    <h4>Career Trajectories of Ministerial Advisers in Belgium (2000–2020)</h4>

<section id="intro">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>My PhD dissertation explores the career trajectories of Belgian ministerial advisers from 2000 to 2020. Ministerial advisers, key figures within the Napoleonic governance system, occupy influential roles, yet their careers remain underexplored. By analyzing their paths, this research seeks to understand their position in the executive triangle and uncover whether ministerial offices operate in a more partitocratic or technocratic manner.</p>

<section id="theory">
  <h2>Theoretical Framework</h2>
  <p>At the core of the dissertation is a central question: Are Belgian ministerial offices partitocratic or technocratic institutions? This tension frames the entire research. The partitocratic perspective emphasizes the political loyalty of advisers as extensions of political parties. In contrast, the technocratic perspective sees these advisers as bureaucratic experts who navigate between the political and administrative worlds. This study addresses these perspectives, building on both public administration and political science literature.</p>

<section id="methodology">
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>To tackle these research questions, we gather career data from ministerial advisers at the federal, Flemish, and Walloon levels of government. The methodology combines traditional approaches with innovative NLP techniques. We leverage prosopography, sequence analysis, and text-as-data methods to model career trajectories, bridging an empirical gap in the field. Our use of large-scale career data collection tools allows us to track the inflow, through-flow, and outflow phases of ministerial careers.</p>

  <h2>Papers</h2>
  <p><strong>1. A Career Dataset of Flemish Ministerial Advisers (1999-2020)</strong></p>
  <p>This paper presents the dataset and tools developed for collecting and analyzing career data on 754 Flemish advisers. It discusses the data collection methodology and basic findings.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Partitocracy or Technocracy? A Resource-Based Perspective</strong></p>
  <p>This paper explores the recruitment patterns of ministerial advisers in Flanders, examining the role of political loyalty versus technical expertise in their appointments.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Charting the Roles and Careers of Ministerial Advisors: A Data-Driven Approach Using NLP</strong></p>
  <p>This paper introduces an NLP-based approach to study the roles of advisers, categorizing them based on their political-neutral alignment and generalist-specialist roles.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Modeling Career Trajectories of Ministerial Advisers: A Markov Chain Approach</strong></p>
  <p>This paper applies Markov Chains to map the career flows of federal and Flemish advisers, revealing the transition dynamics within the political and administrative spheres.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Studying the Post-Cabinet Careers of Belgian Ministerial Advisers</strong></p>
  <p>This final paper focuses on the outflow of ministerial advisers and explores their career paths after leaving office, particularly in the Walloon region.</p>
